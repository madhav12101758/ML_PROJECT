Machine Learning Project on "House Price Predicton"


Problem Statement:

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict house prices for Airbnb listings.

Description:
Airbnb is a popular online marketplace that allows homeowners to rent out their properties to travelers and visitors.
As a host or potential guest, it is crucial to have an understanding of the factors that influence the pricing of Airbnb listings.
The aim of this project is to build a predictive model that can estimate the price of a listing based on various attributes and features.

The dataset provided for this project includes information about Airbnb listings, such as location, property type, number of bedrooms,
amenities, reviews, and other relevant factors. These attributes can provide valuable insights into the pricing patterns of Airbnb properties.

The project involves the following key steps:

Data Preprocessing: Perform data cleaning, handle missing values, and preprocess the dataset to ensure it is suitable for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset. Explore the relationships between variables, 
                                 identify patterns, and visualize the distribution of key features.

Feature Engineering: Extract and transform relevant features from the dataset. This may involve encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical 
                     features, and creating new derived features.

Model Development: Train and evaluate machine learning models on the prepared dataset. Consider regression algorithms suitable for predicting house 
                    prices, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting algorithms.

Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the developed models using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE),
                  mean absolute error (MAE), or R-squared. Compare the performance of different models and select the best-performing one.

Model Deployment: Once the best model is selected, deploy it to a production environment where it can accept input data and provide predictions on new listings.

Price Prediction: Utilize the deployed model to predict the prices of new and unseen Airbnb listings. 
                  Evaluate the model's accuracy and precision by comparing the predicted prices with the actual prices.

The successful completion of this project will provide a reliable and accurate house price prediction model for Airbnb listings.
Hosts and potential guests can utilize this model to estimate the prices of listings and make informed decisions while renting or booking properties 
on the Airbnb platform.
